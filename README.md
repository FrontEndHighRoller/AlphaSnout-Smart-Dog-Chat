# 🐾 Alpha Snout – Dog Talking Buzzers

> An interactive dog training product and e-commerce website. Alpha Snout allows dogs to "communicate" using smart talking buzzers that respond to recorded messages.

## 🐶 Project Overview

Alpha Snout was my personal brand built around a single product: **Dog Talking Buzzers**. These buttons enable dogs to express themselves by associating recorded messages with actions. Users simply record a command (like "play" or "outside") and teach their dog to press the corresponding button. Over repeated use, the dog learns to "talk" with its human.

The project included a **multi-page e-commerce website** showcasing the product, brand story, and testimonials.
